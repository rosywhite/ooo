### Log #5 - rust book ch.2 code cont.
##### Date: Sun, Jan 2, 2022
-----------
Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

- The Rng trait defines methods that random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to use those methods.
- 1..101 is same as 1..=100
- `cargo doc --open`: build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser
- Like Result, Ordering is another enum, but the variants for Ordering are Less, Greater, and Equal
- A match expression is made up of arms. An arm consists of a pattern 
- shadow the previous value of guess with a new one. This feature is often used in situations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another type
- trim method eliminates \n or \r\n
- Additionally, the u32 annotation in this example program and the comparison with secret_number means that Rust will infer that secret_number should be a u32 as well
- Switching from an expect call to a match expression is one way of moving from crashing on an error to handling the error.
- The underscore, _, is a catchall value; in this example, weâ€™re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them
