### Log #4 - rust book ch.2 code
##### Date: Fri, Dec 31, 2021

Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

>let, match, methods, associated functions, using external crates, and more!

>We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

> ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form

- `std` lib has the `io` library, which processes input/output. 
- `use` imports it in the prelude
- `let` statement: used to create a variable
- in Rust, variables are immutable by default (ch3)
- use mut before the variable name to make a variable mutable
- String::new, a function that returns a new instance of a String
- String is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text
- Typee::fn syntax: fn is an associated function of the Typee type
- std::io::stdin is acceptable if no `use` import
- & indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times
- references are immutable by default
- you need to write &mut guess rather than &guess to make it mutable
- handle potential failure with the `Result` type
- `read_line` returns a value—in this case, an io::Result
- Rust has a number of types named Result in its standard library: a generic Result as well as specific versions for submodules, such as io::Result.
