### Log #4 - rust book ch.2 code
##### Date: Fri, Dec 31, 2021
-----------
Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

>let, match, methods, associated functions, using external crates, and more!

>We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

> ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form

- `std` lib has the `io` library, which processes input/output. 
- `use` imports it in the prelude
- `let` statement: used to create a variable
- in Rust, variables are immutable by default (ch3)
- use mut before the variable name to make a variable mutable
- String::new, a function that returns a new instance of a String
- String is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text
- Typee::fn syntax: fn is an associated function of the Typee type
- std::io::stdin is acceptable if no `use` import
- & indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times
- references are immutable by default
- you need to write &mut guess rather than &guess to make it mutable
- handle potential failure with the `Result` type
- `read_line` returns a value—in this case, an io::Result
- Rust has a number of types named Result in its standard library: a generic Result as well as specific versions for submodules, such as io::Result.
- The Result types are enumerations, often referred to as enums. An enumeration is a type that can have a fixed set of values, and those values are called the enum’s variants.
- ??? why is it called 'expect' and not something maybe better like `if_err` or `if_unexpected`? there must be a reason... https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect
- recovering from errors in Chapter 9
- println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);


- Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project we’ve been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The rand crate is a library crate, which contains code intended to be used in other programs.
- The number 0.8.3 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.3, which means any version that is at least 0.8.3 but below 0.9.0
- [dependencies] rand = "0.8.3" // then cargo build
- registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io
- Crates.io: where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use
- When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the Cargo.lock file.
- In other words, your project will remain at 0.8.3 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the Cargo.lock file.
- When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides another command, `update`, which will ignore the Cargo.lock file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in Cargo.toml. If that works, Cargo will write those versions to the Cargo.lock file.
- But by default, Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.3 and less than 0.9.0. 
- If you wanted to use rand version 0.9.0 or any version in the 0.9.x series, you’d have to update the Cargo.toml file to look like this instead: [dependencies] rand = "0.9.0"
- ??? Is registry same as `Cargo.lock`?
