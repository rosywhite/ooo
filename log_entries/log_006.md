### Log #4 - rust book ch.3

Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

- You declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated
- Shadowing: by using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
- The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.
- we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type


- two data type subsets: scalar and compound
- Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. 
- `error[E0282]: type annotations needed`
- four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters
- integers: i8/u8 to i128/u128
- the isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.
- number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, to designate the type
- integer types default to i32
- The primary situation in which you’d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection

Integer Overflow
- Let’s say you have a variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside of that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur.
- When you’re compiling in release mode with the --release flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two’s complement wrapping. 
- The program won’t panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error.
- Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
- Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
- Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
- Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods

- two primitive types for floating-point numbers: f32 and f64
- The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision
- Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

- Integer division rounds down to the nearest integer.
- let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

- Booleans are one byte in size
- char literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes
- Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 
- Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. 
- Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. 
- However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. 
- We’ll discuss this topic in detail in “Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings” in Chapter 8.

- Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays
- A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.
- Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
- Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same.
- `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
- To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value
- `let (x, y, z) = tup;`
- This is called destructuring, because it breaks the single tuple into three parts
- In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access
- `let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
- `let five_hundred = x.0;`
- The tuple without any values, (), is a special type that has only one value, also written (). The type is called the unit type and the value is called the unit value. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.

Arrays
- Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. 
- Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.
- `let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];`
- Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap ... or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements
- An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size.
- If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector.
- `let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` // type & length annotated
- `let a = [3; 5];` is shorthand for `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];`
- **An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack.**
- `let first = a[0];`
- runtime error === panic 
- **This is an example of Rust’s memory safety principles in action.** In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing.
