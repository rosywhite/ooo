### Log #4 - rust book ch.3

Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

- You declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated
- Shadowing: by using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
- The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.
- we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type


- two data type subsets: scalar and compound
- Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. 
- `error[E0282]: type annotations needed`
- four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters
- integers: i8/u8 to i128/u128
- the isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.
- number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, to designate the type
- integer types default to i32
- The primary situation in which you’d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection

Integer Overflow
- Let’s say you have a variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside of that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur.
- When you’re compiling in release mode with the --release flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two’s complement wrapping. 
- The program won’t panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error.
- Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
- Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
- Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
- Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods

- two primitive types for floating-point numbers: f32 and f64
- The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision
- Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

- Integer division rounds down to the nearest integer.
- let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

- Booleans are one byte in size
- char literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes
- Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 
- Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. 
- Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. 
- However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. 
- We’ll discuss this topic in detail in “Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings” in Chapter 8.

- Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays
