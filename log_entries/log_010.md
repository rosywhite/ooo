### Log #10 - rust book ch.5

Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

### intro 

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group

If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object’s data attributes. 

In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with structs.

methods specify behavior associated with a struct type

Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking

### Defining and Instantiating Structs

- Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. - Unlike with tuples, you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean.
- fields
- To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields
- key: value pairs
- To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation.
- If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field.
- Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable. 

```rs
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

- As with any expression, we can construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to implicitly return that new instance.
-  field init shorthand syntax:  write `email` rather than `email: email`


struct update syntax

```rs
    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
```
-  The ..user1 must come last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the corresponding fields in user1, but we can choose to specify values for as many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in the struct’s definition.
-  Note that the struct update syntax is like assignment with = because it moves the data
-  we can no longer use user1 after creating user2 because the String in the username field of user1 was moved into user2
-   The types of active and sign_in_count are types that implement the Copy trait, so the behavior we discussed in the “Stack-Only Data: Copy” section would apply

### Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types

- don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields
- Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple be a different type from other tuples, and naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant
- you can destructure them into their individual pieces
- you can use a . followed by the index to access an individual value

```rs
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
    struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

### unit-like structs

- don’t have any fields! 
- behave similarly to (), the unit type that we mentioned in “The Tuple Type” section
- useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself
- Imagine we’ll be implementing behavior for this type that every instance is always equal to every instance of every other type, perhaps to have a known result for testing purposes. 
- a bit confused on that last point^ (ch10 for more & "how to define traits and implement them on any type")

```rs
struct AlwaysEqual;

    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

### Ownership of Struct Data

- Listing 5-1 uses owned String type rather than the &str string slice type
- we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid
- It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes, a Rust feature that we’ll discuss in Chapter 10. 
- Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.
