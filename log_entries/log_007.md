Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

Functions

- `main` `fn` `a_function();`
- Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere. e.g. after the main function in the source code
- Functions can also be defined to have parameters
- When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters
- Technically, the concrete values are called arguments, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.
- In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter.
- requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean


- Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression
- So far, we’ve only covered functions without an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement.
- Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand
- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. 
- Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.
- Consider a math operation, such as 5 + 6, which is an expression that evaluates to the value 11
-  the 6 in the statement let y = 6; is an expression that evaluates to the value 6
- Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression
- Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value.


- Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (->)
- The main error message, “mismatched types,” reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the function plus_one says that it will return an i32, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by (), the unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to possibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which would fix the error.

Control Flow
- Deciding whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true and deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true are basic building blocks in most programming languages.
- if expressions and loops
- Blocks of code associated with the conditions in if expressions are sometimes called arms, just like the arms in match expressions
- the condition in this code must be a bool
- Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean
- Using too many else if expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called match for these cases.


- Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement
- Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions. 
- the values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the if must be the same type (otherwise won't compile)
- Rust needs to know at compile time what type the number variable is, definitively, so it can verify at compile time that its type is valid everywhere we use number.


- Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while, and for. 
- The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
- If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop and then use the label with break or continue to have those keywords applied to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop.
- you can add the value you want returned after the break expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it `break counter * 2;`
- (while loop example) But this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the index value or test condition are incorrect. It’s also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.
- As a more concise alternative, you can use a for loop and execute some code for each item in a collection.
- When we run this code, we’ll see the same output as in Listing 3-4. More importantly, we’ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the chance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not going far enough and missing some items.
- For example, in the code in Listing 3-4, if you changed the definition of the a array to have four elements but forgot to update the condition to while index < 4, the code would panic. Using the for loop, you wouldn’t need to remember to change any other code if you changed the number of values in the array.
- The safety and conciseness of for loops makes them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust.
- The way to do that would be to use a Range, which is a type provided by the standard library that generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.
