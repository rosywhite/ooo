Functions

- `main` `fn` `a_function();`
- Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere. e.g. after the main function in the source code
- Functions can also be defined to have parameters
- When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters
- Technically, the concrete values are called arguments, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.
- In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter.
- requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean


- Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression
- So far, we’ve only covered functions without an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement.
- Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand
- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. 
- Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.
