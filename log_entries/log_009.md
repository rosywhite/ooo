## References & Borrowing

- A reference is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access data stored at that address that is owned by some other variable. 
- Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type.
- define and use a function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:
- `fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { s.len() }`
- `let len = calculate_length(&s1);`
- These ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.
- Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`.
- The &s1 syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of s1 but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.
- When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.
- We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_.
- Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.


- a mutable reference: `change(&mut s);`
