## References & Borrowing

- A reference is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access data stored at that address that is owned by some other variable. 
- Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type.
- define and use a function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:
- `fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { s.len() }`
- `let len = calculate_length(&s1);`
- These ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.
- Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`.
- The &s1 syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of s1 but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.
- When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.
- We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_.
- Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.


- a mutable reference: `change(&mut s);`
- Mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time.
- The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. 
- The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

  1. Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
  2. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
  3. There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

- Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races!


- Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references.
- `error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable`
- The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL for short), and you can read more about it in The Edition Guide.

Dangling References
- if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.
- Because s is created inside dangle, when the code of dangle is finished, s will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid String. That’s no good! Rust won’t let us do this.
- The solution here is to return the String directly
- This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.

The Rules of References
1. At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
2. References must always be valid.

## The Slice Type

a different kind of reference: slices

- Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. 
- A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.
- (Listing 4-7 code example a bit ahead of my understanding) "Because we get a reference to the element from `.iter().enumerate()`, we use & in the pattern." (?)
- Listing 4-8: This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used word after calling s.clear(). 
- but word isn’t connected to the state of s at all
- Having to worry about the index in `word` getting out of sync with the data in `s` is tedious and error prone

String Slices

```rs
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
```
