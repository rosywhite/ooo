### Log #8 - rust book ch.4

Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

- Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
- several related features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.


- memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time
- None of the ownership features slow down your program while it’s running


- in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions
- the stack and the heap are parts of memory that are available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways
- stack: last in, first out (push/pop)
- All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.
- The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating. 
- Because the pointer is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.
- Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack.
- Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.
- Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there.
- Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory.
- By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.
- When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.

Ownership rules:
- Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.


- A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.
- `let s = "hello";`
- string literal: where the value of the string is hardcoded into the text of our program, immutable
- You can create a String from a string literal using the from function:
- `let s = String::from("hello");`
- String: this type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time.
- The double colon (::) is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular from function under the String type rather than using some sort of name like string_from. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the “Method Syntax” section of Chapter 5 and when we talk about namespacing with modules in “Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree” in Chapter 7.


- In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable.
- With the String type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents.
- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime. (when we call String::from, its implementation requests the memory it needs. )
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our String.
- memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope
- Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly bracket.
- It may seem simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data we’ve allocated on the heap.


- In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s lifetime is sometimes called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII). The drop function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII patterns.

```rs
  let x = 5;
  let y = x;
```

- "bind the value 5 to x; then make a copy of the value in x and bind it to y.” We now have two variables, x and y, and both equal 5. This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two 5 values are pushed onto the stack.

```rs
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let s2 = s1;
```
- The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the String is currently using. 
- The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the String has received from the allocator.
- When we assign s1 to s2, the String data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to. (**see figures in book**)
- Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the drop function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a problem: when s2 and s1 go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a double free error and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.
- To ensure memory safety, there’s one more detail to what happens in this situation in Rust. After let s2 = s1, Rust considers s1 to no longer be valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope.
- invalidated reference `error[E0382]: borrow of moved value:`
- instead of being called a shallow copy, it’s known as a move. In this example, we would say that s1 was moved into s2
- any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.


- If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the String, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called clone
- `let s2 = s1.clone();`
- [with string literal copying] The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after we create the variable y. In other words, there’s no difference between deep and shallow copying here
- Rust has a special annotation called the Copy trait that we can place on types like integers that are stored on the stack
- Rust won’t let us annotate a type with the Copy trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the Drop trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the Copy annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the Copy annotation to your type to implement the trait, see “Derivable Traits” in Appendix C.
- as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement Copy, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement Copy


- All the integer types, such as u32.
- The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
- All the floating point types, such as f64.
- The character type, char.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.
