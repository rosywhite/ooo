Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

- Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
- several related features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.


- memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time
- None of the ownership features slow down your program while it’s running


- in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions
- the stack and the heap are parts of memory that are available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways
- stack: last in, first out (push/pop)
- All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.
- The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating. 
- Because the pointer is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.
- Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack.
- Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.
- Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there.
- Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory.
- By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.
- When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.

Ownership rules:
- Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.


- A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.
- `let s = "hello";`
- string literal: where the value of the string is hardcoded into the text of our program, immutable
- You can create a String from a string literal using the from function:
- `let s = String::from("hello");`
- String: this type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time.
- The double colon (::) is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular from function under the String type rather than using some sort of name like string_from. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the “Method Syntax” section of Chapter 5 and when we talk about namespacing with modules in “Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree” in Chapter 7.


- In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable.
- With the String type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents.
- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime. (when we call String::from, its implementation requests the memory it needs. )
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our String.
- memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope
- Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly bracket.
- It may seem simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data we’ve allocated on the heap.


- In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s lifetime is sometimes called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII). The drop function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII patterns.
