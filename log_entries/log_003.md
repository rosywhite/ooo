### Log #3 - Rust Book intro & ch.1
##### Date: Thu, Dec 30, 2021
-----------
Here's a [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to the Rust Book. :)

>“systems-level” work: deals with low-level details of memory management, data representation, and concurrency

>Low-level code is prone to a variety of subtle bugs ... the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs

>examples of Rust in production: command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies, bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser

>We don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming is or how to think about it. If you’re entirely new to programming, you would be better served by reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming

useful commands: 
- `rustup update`
- `rustc --version`
- `rustup doc`
- `rustc main.rs`
- `./main`

>using a ! means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function, and that macros don't always follow the same rules as functions (more in ch.19)

>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager

>ahead-of-time compiled language: yields binary executable

useful commands:
- `cargo --version`
- `cargo new project_name` // initializes a new Git repository along with a .gitignore file
- `cargo build`
- `./target/debug/project_name`
- `cargo run`
- `cargo check`
- `cargo build --release`

>Cargo.lock: keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project
