### Log #1 - Setting up the dev env
##### Date: Mon Dec 27, 2021
-----------
Got my new handle @rosywhite configured on my cli & pushed a test commit successfully. :)

Updated Node via https://nodejs.org/en/. Result: 

> This package has installed:
>	•	Node.js v16.13.1 to /usr/local/bin/node
>	•	npm v8.1.2 to /usr/local/bin/npm
> Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.

Referenced the `yarn create next-app` [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) & [examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples). Still deciding which repo to start with, although [this blog example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/blog-starter-typescript) looks great. I've used the [with-fela example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-next-css) in depth before, but instead of writing my own component library, thinking of trying out [chakraUI](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-chakra-ui). This is just an mvp, so planning to use JavaScript since I haven't used TypeScript before. Also stoked on the dynamic routing, google analytics, gh-pages, layout, and svg-component examples. Might use a few pieces from the with-next-css (global stylesheet), dynamic-app-layout, image-component & nested-components examples. :)

Stoked on Subsocial and curious to see when they [launch as a parachain](https://cryptoslate.com/subsocial-network-wins-kusamas-16th-parachain-auction-with-over-100k-ksm-raised/). Here's some [news](https://thedefiant.io/polkadot-parachains-running-acala/) about the first five Polkadot parachain winners and super excited to follow their launch journeys. 

Planning to update my macOS from big sur to monterey and update next as well.
