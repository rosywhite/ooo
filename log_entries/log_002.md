### Log #2 - Study notes & roadblocks with Subsocial 
##### Date: Wed, Dec 29, 2021
-----------
Updated my macOS from big sur to monterey. 

Researched more into Subsocial. Exerpts are from the [Subsocial lightpaper docs](https://docs.subsocial.network/docs/lightpaper/).

#### The best parts (security & decentralization ideals):

>On Subsocial, users are the owners of the network. Token holders can participate in the overall governance of the Subsocial platform, but users can also participate in the governance of each space where they are a member. Each space is like a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where members can have ownership and help to steer the way that a space is governed. Space governance is, of course, optional but we believe many spaces will choose to adopt this feature.

>Your login credentials are stored locally on your devices rather than in a centralized database.

>The technical part of adding subscriptions to the Subsocial chain is easy; however, there is still some research to be done with how to handle hosting for private content in a decentralized way while preserving creator privacy.

>One of the most exciting aspects of Polkadot is the ability for one parachain to trustlessly interact with another. This also means it should be possible to use any token on Polkadot to make payments on Subsocial. The primary interest for this is likely to be paying for subscriptions in either DOT, KSM, ACA, or the native SubSocial token.

#### Current roadblocks for my dev goals: 

>The technical part of adding subscriptions to the Subsocial chain is easy; however, there is still some research to be done with how to handle hosting for private content in a decentralized way while preserving creator privacy.

>The Subsocial team started building primitives during Hackusama such as tips and paid subscriptions. These will be available at launch. In the future we hope to add pay-per-view and NFTs in the runtime.

>Beyond v1.0. A feature that we are currently exploring is Pay-Per-View (PPV). Preliminary research suggests this could be done using a Trusted Execution Environment as we see in the SubstraTEE project.

Subsocial was built on Substrate. My favorite notes from the [Substrate docs](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/overview/):

>One chief goal of Substrate, as a core component of the Web3 vision, is to ensure true decentralization, meaning users do not need to go through intermediaries in order to use "decentralized" applications. Bitcoin started down this path with its "SPV" client technology, but for more generalistic chains and frameworks, the task is rather more complex.

>For this reason, Substrate is dedicated to the use of open, well-adopted and web-literate technologies, such as Webassembly and libp2p, as well as light-client technology. Only with an enduring focus on these can we deliver browser and mobile applications with no greater a barrier to adoption than traditionally centralized applications, a critical requirement for delivering the promised independence and self-sovereignty of the Web3 vision.

>The limitations of general-purpose smart-contract blockchains

>Developing a new project specific to your use-case by reusing a general-purpose smart-contract blockchain forces you to inherit all of that blockchainâ€™s design decisions, which are often made with different priorities in mind than your own.

>For example, reusing the Ethereum codebase implies several limitations: having to place all of your business logic in terms of the EVM, being forced to use one of the two EVM languages, having all business logic dynamically metered, and being limited to Ethereum's transaction pool and lack of core upgradability.

>By forcing these design decisions on yourself, you already place hard constraints on what you can practically engineer and how much you can really innovate. You also dramatically limit the performance of your application logic.

>Polkadot is a layer-0 protocol and multichain network laying the foundation for the future of Web3. Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.

>Substrate allows you to create specialized blockchains for any use case, and was used by Parity Technologies to create Polkadot itself, which attests to its high level of performance, flexibility, and robustness.

>Substrate strives to be the best blockchain framework in which to build your custom blockchain. Substrate is not a blockchain in itself, but akin to a blockchain SDK framework. Substrate empowers you to build beyond the capabilities of others, giving you the freedom to define your chain however you want.

The current state of Subsocial development from [a news article](https://u.today/subsocial-secures-kusama-slot-shares-sub-distribution-plan): 

>With its first parachain slot leased, SubSocial is now able to utilize XCMP, Kusama's cross-chain message-passing protocol. This protocol allows it to interact with other products on Polkadot and Kusama.

>The platform goes live in mainnet on Jan. 8, 2022
Also, its SUB token will be listed on decentralized exchanges to ensure a constant liquidity inflow to the ecosystem. In turn, other "social" tokens can be seamlessly used in SubSocial's projects.

>Once its parachain slot goes live [on Kusama] on Jan. 8, 2022, the ongoing beta version of SubSocial will be relaunched as a standalone mainnet.

After research, then, I cloned some code: the [subsocial react example](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-react-example). It's a pretty big codebase written in TypeScript. The auth seems really well done when I tested it locally by downloading the Polkadot{.js} wallet Chrome extension & connecting my wallet. It's a Space aggregator so pulls all the Subsocial Spaces. 

Roadblocks for me:
 - I can't easily test since the SUB faucet is down till mainnet ~Jan 8, 2022
 - I noticed there is a SUB cost per like/comment, but since I have no SUB, I'm unsure what that cost is and how to account for it into my biz model
 - The biggest roadblock is: there's no current tech solution to "handle hosting for private content in a decentralized way". SubstraTEE project is working on that with their Trusted Execution Environment though, so I plan to track their progress. :)

Unfortunately, I probably need to wait till SubstraTEE(rebranded to Integritee) or another project figures out decentralized private content so I can age-restrict my content and use PPV rather than subscription. It would be cool to try to work for them actually. :)  

This brings me back to a long-time project of mine: reading through and doing the exercises for the entire Rust Book & Rustonomicon. I've done it through 8 of the 20 chapters of the Rust Book. After that, maybe go through Rustlings exercises or build something with Rust. I started studying Rust and compiler design in early 2020 because I wanted to build a Rust compiler. That was really fun but I stopped cause I got a startup job. 

If I resume Rust studies, I could actually potentially read source code for Polkadot, Substrate, Subsocial, Solana, Deno, etc., and then I could use the Subsocial Rust API instead of the Subsocial JavaScript API.

So, I used a Next template to code [this quick website](https://diary-gamma.vercel.app/) to host my diary posts and save them on github with timestamps. I haven't connected my custom domain yet but would be fun to later. I made another [diary repo](https://github.com/rosywhite/diary) on here for that.



### TL;DR: Updated plan: 
- just have a [simple website](https://diary-gamma.vercel.app/) for now
- upgrade my Rust skills to potentially unlock lots of new opportunities & make log entries of my Rust studies
- focus on video content for ofans/the hub :)
